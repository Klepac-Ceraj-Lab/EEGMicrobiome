  abstract = {Crosstalk between gut and brain has long been appreciated in health and disease, and the gut microbiota is a key player in communication between these two distant organs. Yet, the mechanisms through which the microbiota influences development and function of the gut–brain axis remain largely unknown. Barriers present in the gut and brain are specialized cellular interfaces that maintain strict homeostasis of different compartments across this axis. These barriers include the gut epithelial barrier, the blood–brain barrier and the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier. Barriers are ideally positioned to receive and communicate gut microbial signals constituting a gateway for gut–microbiota–brain communication. In this Review, we focus on how modulation of these barriers by the gut microbiota can constitute an important channel of communication across the gut–brain axis. Moreover, barrier malfunction upon alterations in gut microbial composition could form the basis of various conditions, including often comorbid neurological and gastrointestinal disorders. Thus, we should focus on unravelling the molecular and cellular basis of this communication and move from simplistic framing as ‘leaky gut’. A mechanistic understanding of gut microbiota modulation of barriers, especially during critical windows of development, could be key to understanding the aetiology of gastrointestinal and neurological disorders.},

  abstract = {Alterations in the gut microbiota composition have been associated with a range of neurodevelopmental, neurodegenerative, and neuropsychiatric disorders. The gut microbes transform and metabolize dietary- and host-derived molecules generating a diverse group of metabolites with local and systemic effects. The bi-directional communication between brain and the microbes residing in the gut, the so-called gut–brain axis, consists of a network of immunological, neuronal, and endocrine signaling pathways. Although the full variety of mechanisms of the gut–brain crosstalk is yet to be established, the existing data demonstrates that a single metabolite or its derivatives are likely among the key inductors within the gut–brain axis communication. However, more research is needed to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying how gut microbiota associated metabolites alter brain functions, and to examine if different interventional approaches targeting the gut microbiota could be used in prevention and treatment of neurological disorders, as reviewed herein.

Among the 16,440 Swedish children followed across time, 1,197 developed an ND. Significant associations emerged for future ND diagnosis in general and for specific ND subtypes, spanning intellectual disability, speech disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, and autism. This investigation revealed microbiome connections to future diagnosis as well as early emerging mood and gastrointestinal problems. The findings suggest links to immunodysregulation and metabolism, compounded by stress, early-life infection, and antibiotics. The convergence of infant biomarkers and risk factors in this prospective, longitudinal study on a large-scale population establishes a foundation for early-life prediction and intervention in neurodevelopment.},

Characteristics of GABA entry into the immature rat brain is yet to be addressed. This investigation was set to study the entry of GABA into brain of the neonatal rat compared to the adult. Using the bilateral in situ brain perfusion technique, the entry of 14C-GABA into brain, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and lateral ventricles choroid plexuses was studied in the adult and neonatal rats. 14C-GABA uptake into neonatal rat brain after 20 min perfusion was 0.116±0.014 ml g−1, approximately twice that of the adults (P{$<$}0.01). Half saturation constant, Km, did not change with age (P{$>$}0.05), whereas maximal transport into the brain, Vmax, was reduced from 0.152 to 0.068 nmol min−1 g−1 showing a significant reduction with age (P{$<$}0.05). In the neonate the entry of GABA into the CSF was dominant when compared to that into the brain, this could be due to a greater diffusional component, Kd, which was detected to be high in the neonate. In conclusion, the uptake of 14C-GABA into brain of the immature rats exceeded that in the adults which is thought to be due to both greater maximal transport and greater diffusion in the neonate compared to the adult.},

  abstract = {A complex bidirectional communication system exists between the gastrointestinal tract and the brain. Initially termed the “gut-brain axis” it is now renamed the “microbiota-gut-brain axis” considering the pivotal role of gut microbiota in maintaining local and systemic homeostasis. Different cellular and molecular pathways act along this axis and strong attention is paid to neuroactive molecules (neurotransmitters, i.e., noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, gamma aminobutyric acid and glutamate and metabolites, i.e., tryptophan metabolites), sustaining a possible interkingdom communication system between eukaryota and prokaryota. This review provides a description of the most up-to-date evidence on glutamate as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in this bidirectional communication axis. Modulation of glutamatergic receptor activity along the microbiota-gut-brain axis may influence gut (i.e., taste, visceral sensitivity and motility) and brain functions (stress response, mood and behavior) and alterations of glutamatergic transmission may participate to the pathogenesis of local and brain disorders. In this latter context, we will focus on two major gut disorders, such as irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease, both characterized by psychiatric co-morbidity. Research in this area opens the possibility to target glutamatergic neurotransmission, either pharmacologically or by the use of probiotics producing neuroactive molecules, as a therapeutic approach for the treatment of gastrointestinal and related psychiatric disorders.},

  abstract = {Pattern reversal stimulation provides an established tool for assessing the integrity of the visual pathway and for studying early visual processing. Numerous magnetoencephalographic (MEG) and electroencephalographic (EEG) studies have revealed a three-phasic waveform of the averaged pattern reversal visual evoked potential/magnetic field, with components N75(m), P100(m), and N145(m). However, the anatomical assignment of these components to distinct cortical generators is still a matter of debate, which has inter alia connected with considerable interindividual variations of the human striate and extrastriate cortex. The anatomical variability can be compensated for by means of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps, which are three-dimensional maps obtained by an observer-independent statistical mapping in a sample of ten postmortem brains. Transformed onto a subject's brain under consideration, these maps provide the probability with which a given voxel of the subject's brain belongs to a particular cytoarchitectonic area. We optimize the spatial selectivity of the probability maps for V1 and V2 with a probability threshold which optimizes the self- vs. cross-overlap in the population of postmortem brains used for deriving the probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps. For the first time, we use probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of visual cortical areas in order to anatomically identify active cortical generators underlying pattern reversal visual evoked magnetic fields as revealed by MEG. The generators are determined with magnetic field tomography (MFT), which reconstructs the current source density in each voxel. In all seven subjects, our approach reveals generators in V1/V2 (with a greater overlap with V1) and in V5 unilaterally (right V5 in three subjects, left V5 in four subjects) and consistent time courses of their stimulus-locked activations, with three peak activations in V1/V2 (contributing to C1m/N75m, P100m, and N145m) and two peak activations in V5 (contributing to P100m and N145m). The reverberating V1/V2 and V5 activations demonstrate the effect of recurrent activation mechanisms including V1 and extrastriate areas and/or corticofugal feedback loops. Our results demonstrate that the combined investigation of MEG signals with MFT and probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps significantly improves the anatomical identification of active brain areas.},

The formula and data together determine a numerical representation of the model from which the profiled deviance or the profiled REML criterion can be evaluated as a function of some of the model parameters. The appropriate criterion is optimized, using one of the constrained optimization functions in R, to provide the parameter estimates. We describe the structure of the model, the steps in evaluating the profiled deviance or REML criterion, and the structure of classes or types that represents such a model. Sufficient detail is included to allow specialization of these structures by users who wish to write functions to fit specialized linear mixed models, such as models incorporating pedigrees or smoothing splines, that are not easily expressible in the formula language used by lmer.},

We investigated the relationship between the microbiome and neuroanatomy and cognition of 381 healthy children, demonstrating that differences in microbial taxa and genes are associated with overall cognitive function and the size of brain regions. Using a combination of statistical and machine learning models, we showed that species including Alistipes obesi, Blautia wexlerae, and Ruminococcus gnavus were enriched or depleted in children with higher cognitive function scores. Microbial metabolism of short-chain fatty acids was also associated with cognitive function. In addition, machine models were able to predict the volume of brain regions from microbial profiles, and taxa that were important in predicting cognitive function were also important for predicting individual brain regions and specific subscales of cognitive function. These findings provide potential biomarkers of neurocognitive development and may enable development of targets for early detection and intervention.},

  abstract = {Microglia play a vital role maintaining brain homeostasis but can also cause persistent neuroinflammation. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the intestinal microbiota have been suggested to regulate microglia inflammation indirectly by signaling through the gut-brain axis or directly by reaching the brain. The present work evaluated the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs on lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated microglia from mice fed inulin, a soluble fiber that is fermented by intestinal microbiota to produce SCFAs in vivo, and SCFAs applied to primary microglia in vitro. Feeding mice inulin increased SCFAs in the cecum and in plasma collected from the hepatic portal vein. Microglia isolated from mice fed inulin and stimulated with LPS in vitro secreted less tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)~compared to microglia from mice not given inulin. Additionally, when mice were fed inulin and injected i.p with LPS, the ex vivo secretion of TNF-α by isolated microglia was lower than that secreted by microglia from mice not fed inulin and injected with LPS. Similarly, in vitro treatment of primary microglia with acetate and butyrate either alone or in combination downregulated microglia cytokine production with the effects being additive. SCFAs reduced histone deacetylase activity and nuclear factor-κB nuclear translocation after LPS treatment in vitro. Whereas microglia expression of SCFA receptors Ffar2 or Ffar3 was not detected by single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, the SCFA transporters Mct1 and Mct4 were. Nevertheless, inhibiting monocarboxylate transporters on primary microglia did not interfere with the anti-inflammatory effects of SCFAs, suggesting that if SCFAs produced in the gut regulate microglia directly it is likely through an epigenetic mechanism following diffusion.},

Interactions between the brain and bacteria that live within the gastrointestinal system (the microbiome) underlie adversity–gastrointestinal–anxiety interactions, but these links have not been investigated during human development. In this study, we utilized data from a population of 344 youth (3–18 years old) who were raised with their biological parents or were exposed to early adverse caregiving experiences (i.e., institutional or foster care followed by international adoption) to explore adversity–gastrointestinal–anxiety associations. In Study 1, we demonstrated that previous adverse care experiences were associated with increased incidence of gastrointestinal symptoms in youth. Gastrointestinal symptoms were also associated with concurrent and future anxiety (measured across 5 years), and those gastrointestinal symptoms mediated the adversity–anxiety association at Time 1. In a subsample of children who provided both stool samples and functional magnetic resonance imaging of the brain (Study 2, which was a “proof-of-principle”), adversity was associated with changes in diversity (both alpha and beta) of microbial communities, and bacteria levels (adversity-associated and adversity-independent) were correlated with prefrontal cortex activation to emotional faces. Implications of these data for supporting youth mental health are discussed.},

  abstract = {With the aging of the United States population, age-related cognitive disorders will be more prevalent and will negatively impact society. Differences in factors within and among individuals that influence cognitive decline complicate studies on the topic. One difference among individuals - gut microbiome diversity and composition - changes within the person across their lifespan and varies among individuals. An individual's gut microflora can significantly influence gut-brain communication, brain function, and behavior. Little research has been done to evaluate the gut-brain relation in non-clinical populations, with no previous studies, to our knowledge, in healthy older adults. In the present study, we investigated the relation between microbiome diversity and cognitive decline. The researchers invited sixty-three healthy older adults between 67-83 years of age to provide a fecal sample and complete an electrophysiological assessment of brain potentials (Event-Related Potentials; ERP) and the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Electrophysiological and behavioral data were related to alpha diversity, a measure of the variety of species in the gut-microbiome, supporting the hypothesis that a relation exists between gut microbial diversity and cognitive performance in healthy older adults as measured by CANTAB and ERP. To our knowledge, this study is the first to demonstrate the association between ERP outcomes and the gut-microbiome. Our results begin to bridge the gap in our understanding of the connection between behavior and the composition of the gut-microbiome, commonly referred to as the gut-brain connection.},

In particular, experimental manipulations that alter intestinal microbiota impact exploratory and communicative behaviors and cognitive performance. In humans, the first years of life are a dynamic time in gut colonization and brain development, but little is known about the relationship between these two processes. METHODS: We tested whether microbial composition at 1 year of age is associated with cognitive outcomes using the Mullen Scales of Early Learning and with global and regional brain volumes using structural magnetic resonance imaging at 1 and 2 years of age. Fecal samples were collected from 89 typically developing 1-year-olds. 16S ribosomal RNA amplicon sequencing was used for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. RESULTS: Cluster analysis identified 3 groups of infants defined by their bacterial composition. Mullen scores at 2~years of age differed significantly between clusters. In addition, higher alpha diversity was associated with lower scores on the overall composite score, visual reception scale, and expressive language scale at 2 years of age. Exploratory analyses of neuroimaging data suggest the gut microbiome has minimal effects on regional brain volumes at 1 and 2 years of age. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to demonstrate associations between the gut microbiota and cognition in human infants. As such, it represents an essential first step in translating animal data into the clinic.},

These processes are key factors underpinning central nervous system (CNS) signalling. Regulation of the microbiome–gut–brain axis is essential for maintaining homeostasis, including that of the CNS. However, there is a paucity of data pertaining to the influence of microbiome on the serotonergic system. Germ-free (GF) animals represent an effective preclinical tool to investigate such phenomena. Here we show that male GF animals have a significant elevation in the hippocampal concentration of 5-hydroxytryptamine and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, its main metabolite, compared with conventionally colonised control animals. Moreover, this alteration is sex specific in contrast with the immunological and neuroendocrine effects which are evident in both sexes. Concentrations of tryptophan, the precursor of serotonin, are increased in the plasma of male GF animals, suggesting a humoral route through which the microbiota can influence CNS serotonergic neurotransmission. Interestingly, colonisation of the GF animals post weaning is insufficient to reverse the CNS neurochemical consequences in adulthood of an absent microbiota in early life despite the peripheral availability of tryptophan being restored to baseline values. In addition, reduced anxiety in GF animals is also normalised following restoration of the intestinal microbiota. These results demonstrate that CNS neurotransmission can be profoundly disturbed by the absence of a normal gut microbiota and that this aberrant neurochemical, but not behavioural, profile is resistant to restoration of a normal gut flora in later life.},

Furthermore, research directly exploring the role of SCFAs as potential mediators of the effects of microbiota-t argeted interventions on affective and cognitive functioning is sparse, especially in humans. This Review summarizes existing knowledge on the potential of SCFAs to directly or indirectly mediate microbiota–gut–brain interactions. The effects of SCFAs on cellular systems and their interaction with gut–brain signalling pathways including immune, endocrine, neural and humoral routes are described. The effects of microbiota-t argeted interventions such as prebiotics, probiotics and diet on psychological functioning and the putative mediating role of SCFA signalling will also be discussed, as well as the relationship between SCFAs and psychobiological processes.

We examine common growth functions to find the most representative model of myelin maturation and subsequently use the best of these models to develop a continuous population-averaged, four-dimensional model of normative myelination. Through comparisons with an independent sample of 63 male children across the same age span, we show that the developed model is representative of this population. This work contributes to understanding the trajectory of myelination in healthy infants and toddlers, furthering our knowledge of early brain development, and provides a model that may be useful for identifying developmental abnormalities.},

Novel methods were developed to scan awake infants with fMRI, while they viewed multiple categories of visual stimuli. Here we report that the visual cortex of 4–6-month-old infants contains regions that respond preferentially to abstract categories (faces and scenes), with a spatial organization similar to adults. However, precise response profiles and patterns of activity across multiple visual categories differ between infants and adults. These results demonstrate that the large-scale organization of category preferences in visual cortex is adult-like within a few months after birth, but is subsequently refined through development.},

We identified acetate as the essential microbiome-derived SCFA driving microglia maturation and regulating the homeostatic metabolic state, and further showed that it is able to modulate microglial phagocytosis and disease progression during neurodegeneration. These findings indicate that acetate is an essential bacteria-derived molecule driving metabolic pathways and functions of microglia during health and perturbation.},

  abstract = {Neuronal circuits across several systems display remarkable plasticity to sensory input during postnatal development. Experience-dependent refinements are often restricted to well-defined critical periods in early life, but how these are established remains mostly unknown. A representative example is the loss of responsiveness in neocortex to an eye deprived of vision. Here we show that the potential for plasticity is retained throughout life until an inhibitory threshold is attained. In mice of all ages lacking an isoform of GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) synthetic enzyme (GAD65), as well as in immature wild-type animals before the onset of their natural critical period, benzodiazepines selectively reduced a prolonged discharge phenotype to unmask plasticity. Enhancing GABA-mediated transmission early in life rendered mutant animals insensitive to monocular deprivation as adults, similar to normal wild-type mice. Short-term presynaptic dynamics reflected a synaptic reorganization in GAD65 knockout mice after chronic diazepam treatment. A threshold level of inhibition within the visual cortex may thus trigger, once in life, an experience-dependent critical period for circuit consolidation, which may otherwise lie dormant.},

  abstract = {Several studies have been carried out in the last 30 years in the attempt to clarify the possible role of glutamate as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the gastrointestinal tract. Such effort has provided immunohistochemical, biomolecular and functional data suggesting that the entire glutamatergic neurotransmitter machinery is present in the complex circuitries of the enteric nervous system (ENS), which participates to the local coordination of gastrointestinal functions. Glutamate is also involved in the regulation of the brain-gut axis, a bi-directional connection pathway between the central nervous system (CNS) and the gut. The neurotransmitter contributes to convey information, via afferent fibers, from the gut to the brain, and to send appropriate signals, via efferent fibers, from the brain to control gut secretion and motility. In analogy with the CNS, an increasing number of studies suggest that dysregulation of the enteric glutamatergic neurotransmitter machinery may lead to gastrointestinal dysfunctions. On the whole, this research field has opened the possibility to find new potential targets for development of drugs for the treatment of gastrointestinal diseases. The present review analyzes the more recent literature on enteric glutamatergic neurotransmission both in physiological and pathological conditions, such as gastroesophageal reflux, gastric acid hypersecretory diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome and intestinal ischemia/reperfusion injury.},

  abstract = {Early exposure to antibiotics has been shown to increase risk for poor neurobehavioral development, particularly with regard to attention deficit disorders. Clinically, electroencephalography (EEG) is increasingly used as a biomarker of these deficits. Less is known about the effects of antibiotics on neurobehavioral and neurophysiological outcomes in preterm infants, a population at particularly high risk for attention deficits and perinatal antibiotic exposure. This study examines the effects of perinatal antibiotic exposure on neonatal EEG and attention deficits as measured by the Child Behavior Checklist in 4‐ to 5‐year‐old children who were enrolled in an NICU‐based randomized controlled trial comparing Family Nurture Intervention (FNI) to standard care. Antibiotic‐exposed infants had increased attention problems and there was a main effect of antibiotic exposure such that exposed infants had higher EEG power. This effect was fourfold greater in infants who received standard NICU care compared to those who received the intervention, suggesting a buffering effect of the intervention. We hypothesize that the relationship between antibiotic exposure and altered neurodevelopment may be due to effects of antibiotics on the microbiome, and that FNI may buffer these adverse consequences.},

  abstract = {Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the possibility that microbial communities inhabiting the human gut could affect cognitive development and increase risk for mental illness via the “microbiome-gut-brain axis.” Infancy likely represents a critical period for the establishment of these relationships, as it is the most dynamic stage of postnatal brain development and a key period in the maturation of the microbiome. Indeed, recent reports indicate that characteristics of the infant gut microbiome are associated with both temperament and cognitive performance. The neural circuits underlying these relationships have not yet been delineated. To address this gap, resting-state fMRI scans were acquired from 39 1-year-old human infants who had provided fecal samples for identification and relative quantification of bacterial taxa. Measures of alpha diversity were generated and tested for associations with measures of functional connectivity. Primary analyses focused on the amygdala as manipulation of the gut microbiota in animal models alters the structure and neurochemistry of this brain region. Secondary analyses explored functional connectivity of nine canonical resting-state functional networks. Alpha diversity was significantly associated with functional connectivity between the amygdala and thalamus and between the anterior cingulate cortex and anterior insula. These regions play an important role in processing/responding to threat. Alpha diversity was also associated with functional connectivity between the supplementary motor area (SMA, representing the sensorimotor network) and the inferior parietal lobule (IPL). Importantly, SMA-IPL connectivity also related to cognitive outcomes at 2~years of age, suggesting a potential pathway linking gut microbiome diversity and cognitive outcomes during infancy. These results provide exciting new insights into the gut-brain axis during early human development and should stimulate further studies into whether microbiome-associated changes in brain circuitry influence later risk for psychopathology.},

These modifications are facilitated by the neuromodulators noradrenaline and acetylcholine. To address the question of whether serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT), the other major neuromodulator in the cerebral cortex, also plays a role in developmental plasticity, we investigated whether interference with serotoninergic transmission in the kitten visual cortex affects ocular dominance (OD) plasticity. The serotonin neurotoxin 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine or the serotonin receptor blockers ketanserin and methysergide were infused into the visual cortex of kittens undergoing monocular deprivation. We found that both methods of disrupting serotoninergic transmission reduced OD plasticity. However, to be effective, the receptor blockers ketanserin and methysergide had to be applied in combination, suggesting that coactivation of serotonin receptor subtypes of both the 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 families have a permissive function in OD plasticity. Since activation of 5-HT2 receptors stimulates phosphoinositide hydrolysis, our data suggest that second messengers from the phospholipid pathway may play an important role in developmental plasticity of visual cortex.},

Hebbian mechanisms of synaptic plasticity are insufficient to account for reinforced learning because neuromodulators signaling biological relevance are delayed with respect to the neural activity associated with the stimulus. A theoretical solution is the concept of eligibility traces (eTraces), silent synaptic processes elicited by activity which upon arrival of a neuromodulator are converted into a lasting change in synaptic strength. Previously we demonstrated in visual cortical slices the Hebbian induction of eTraces and their conversion into LTP and LTD by the retroactive action of norepinephrine and serotonin Here we show in vivo in mouse V1 that the induction of eTraces and their conversion to LTP/D by norepinephrine and serotonin respectively potentiates and depresses visual responses. We also show that the integrity of this process is crucial for ocular dominance plasticity, a canonical model of experience-dependent plasticity.},

Microbiota colonization occurs before the maturation of many neural systems and is linked to brain health. Because of this it has been hypothesized that the early microbiome interactions along the gut-brain axis evolved to promote advanced cognitive functions and behaviors. Here, we performed a pilot study with a multidisciplinary approach to test if the microbiota composition of infants is associated with measures of early cognitive development, in particular neural rhythm tracking; language (forward speech) versus non-language (backwards speech) discrimination; and social joint attention. Fecal samples were collected from 56 infants between four and six months of age and sequenced by shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Of these, 44 performed the behavioral Point and Gaze test to measure joint attention. Infants were tested on either language discrimination using functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS; 25 infants had usable data) or neural rhythm tracking using electroencephalogram (EEG; 15 had usable data). Infants who succeeded at the Point and Gaze test tended to have increased Actinobacteria and reduced Firmicutes at the phylum level; and an increase in               Bifidobacterium               and               Eggerthella               along with a reduction in               Hungatella               and               Streptococcus               at the genus level.

No associations were found for the fNIRS language discrimination measurements.

  abstract = {The gut microbiome has been shown to regulate the development and functions of the enteric and central nervous systems. Its involvement in the regulation of behavior has attracted particular attention because of its potential translational importance in clinical disorders, however little is known about the pathways involved. We previously have demonstrated that administration of Lactobacillus rhamnosus (JB-1) to healthy male BALB/c mice, promotes consistent changes in GABA-A and -B receptor sub-types in specific brain regions, accompanied by reductions in anxiety and depression-related behaviors. In the present study, using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS), we quantitatively assessed two clinically validated biomarkers of brain activity and function, glutamate+glutamine (Glx) and total N-acetyl aspartate+N-acetyl aspartyl glutamic acid (tNAA), as well as GABA, the chief brain inhibitory neurotransmitter. Mice received 1×10(9) cfu of JB-1 per day for 4weeks and were subjected to MRS weekly and again 4weeks after cessation of treatment to ascertain temporal changes in these neurometabolites. Baseline concentrations for Glx, tNAA and GABA were equal to 10.4±0.3mM, 8.7±0.1mM, and 1.2±0.1mM, respectively. Delayed increases were first seen for Glx (\textasciitilde 10\%) and NAA (\textasciitilde 37\%) at 2weeks which persisted only to the end of treatment. However, Glx was still elevated 4weeks after treatment had ceased. Significantly elevated GABA (\textasciitilde 25\%) was only seen at 4weeks. These results suggest specific metabolic pathways in our pursuit of mechanisms of action of psychoactive bacteria. They also offer through application of standard clinical neurodiagnostic techniques, translational opportunities to assess biomarkers accompanying behavioral changes induced by alterations in the gut microbiome.},

Toward this end we have been developing a knowledge‐based approach for network prediction, which is to predict, given a complete set of genes in the genome, the protein interaction networks that are responsible for various cellular processes. KEGG at http://www.genome.ad.jp/kegg/ is the reference knowledge base that integrates current knowledge on molecular interaction networks such as pathways and complexes (PATHWAY database), information about genes and proteins generated by genome projects (GENES/SSDB/KO databases) and information about biochemical compounds and reactions (COMPOUND/GLYCAN/REACTION databases). These three types of database actually represent three graph objects, called the protein network, the gene universe and the chemical universe. New efforts are being made to abstract knowledge, both computationally and manually, about ortholog clusters in the KO (KEGG Orthology) database, and to collect and analyze carbohydrate structures in the GLYCAN database.},

  abstract = {Recently, it has been found that the gut microbiota influences functions of the host brain by affecting monoamine metabolism. The present study focused on the relationship between the gut microbiota and the brain amino acids. Specific pathogen-free (SPF) and germ-free (GF) mice were used as experimental models. Plasma and brain regions were sampled from mice at 7 and 16 weeks of age, and analysed for free d- and l-amino acids, which are believed to affect many physiological functions. At 7 weeks of age, plasma concentrations of d-aspartic acid (d-Asp), l-alanine (l-Ala), l-glutamine (l-Gln) and taurine were higher in SPF mice than in GF mice, but no differences were found at 16 weeks of age. Similar patterns were observed for the concentrations of l-Asp in striatum, cerebral cortex and hippocampus, and l-arginine (l-Arg), l-Ala and l-valine (l-Val) in striatum. In addition, the concentrations of l-Asp, d-Ala, l-histidine, l-isoleucine (l-Ile), l-leucine (l-Leu), l-phenylalanine and l-Val were significantly higher in plasma of SPF mice when compared with those of GF mice. The concentrations of l-Arg, l-Gln, l-Ile and l-Leu were significantly higher in SPF than in GF mice, but those of d-Asp, d-serine and l-serine were higher in some brain regions of GF mice than in those of SPF mice. In conclusion, the concentration of amino acids in the host brain seems to be dependent on presence of the gut microbiota. Amino acid metabolism in the host brain may be modified by manipulating microbiota communities.},

  abstract = {The gut microbiome appears to play an important role in human health and disease. However, only little is known about how variability in the gut microbiome contributes to individual differences during early and sensitive stages of brain and behavioral development. The current study examined the link between gut microbiome, brain, and behavior in newborn infants (N = 63; M [age] = 25 days). Infant gut microbiome di­ versity was measured from stool samples using metagenomic sequencing, infant functional brain network con­ nectivity was assessed using a resting state functional near infrared spectroscopy (rs-fNIRS) procedure, and infant behavioral temperament was assessed using parental report. Our results show that gut microbiota composition is linked to individual variability in brain network connectivity, which in turn mediated individual differences in behavioral temperament, specifically negative emotionality, among infants. Furthermore, virulence factors, possibly indexing pathogenic activity, were associated with differences in brain network connectivity linked to negative emotionality. These findings provide novel insights into the early developmental origins of the gut microbiome-brain axis and its association with variability in important behavioral traits. This suggests that the gut microbiome is an important biological factor to consider when studying human development and health.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of energy homeostasis is essential for life, and its dysregulation leads to a variety of metabolic disorders. Under a fed condition, mammals use glucose as the main metabolic fuel, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) produced by the colonic bacterial fermentation of dietary fiber also contribute a significant proportion of daily energy requirement. Under ketogenic conditions such as starvation and diabetes, ketone bodies produced in the liver from fatty acids are used as the main energy sources. To balance energy intake, dietary excess and starvation trigger an increase or a decrease in energy expenditure, respectively, by regulating the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). The regulation of metabolic homeostasis by glucose is well recognized; however, the roles of SCFAs and ketone bodies in maintaining energy balance remain unclear. Here, we show that SCFAs and ketone bodies directly regulate SNS activity via GPR41, a Gi/o protein-coupled receptor for SCFAs, at the level of the sympathetic ganglion. GPR41 was most abundantly expressed in sympathetic ganglia in mouse and humans. SCFA propionate promoted sympathetic outflow via GPR41. On the other hand, a ketone body, β-hydroxybutyrate, produced during starvation or diabetes, suppressed SNS activity by antagonizing GPR41. Pharmacological and siRNA experiments indicated that GPR41-mediated activation of sympathetic neurons involves Gβγ-PLCβ-MAPK signaling. Sympathetic regulation by SCFAs and ketone bodies correlated well with their respective effects on energy consumption. These findings establish that SCFAs and ketone bodies directly regulate GPR41-mediated SNS activity and thereby control body energy expenditure in maintaining metabolic homeostasis.},

This selected review examines the development of visual function and its neural correlates, and highlights the fact that in most cases receptive field properties of infant neurons are substantially more mature than infant visual function. One exception is temporal resolution, which can be accounted for by resolution of neurons at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In terms of spatial vision, properties of single neurons alone are not sufficient to account for visual development. Different visual functions develop over different time courses. Their onset may be limited by the existence of neural response properties that support a given perceptual ability, but the subsequent time course of maturation to adult levels remains unexplained. Several examples are offered suggesting that taking account of weak signaling by infant neurons, correlated firing, and pooled responses of populations of neurons brings us closer to an understanding of the relationship between neural and behavioral development. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Glutamate, cystine deprivation, homocysteic acid, and the glutathione synthesis inhibitor buthionine sulfoximine all cause oxidative injury to immature neurons and oligodendrocytes by depleting intracellular glutathione. Although vitamin K is not a classical antioxidant, we report here the novel finding that vitamin K1 and K2 (menaquinone-4) potently inhibit glutathione depletion-mediated oxidative cell death in primary cultures of oligodendrocyte precursors and immature fetal cortical neurons with EC50 values of 30 nm and 2 nm, respectively. The mechanism by which vitamin K blocks oxidative injury is independent of its only known biological function as a cofactor for γ-glutamylcarboxylase, an enzyme responsible for posttranslational modification of specific proteins. Neither oligodendrocytes nor neurons possess significant vitamin K-dependent carboxylase or epoxidase activity. Furthermore, the vitamin K antagonists warfarin and dicoumarol and the direct carboxylase inhibitor 2-chloro-vitamin K1 have no effect on the protective function of vitamin K against oxidative injury. Vitamin K does not prevent the depletion of intracellular glutathione caused by cystine deprivation but completely blocks free radical accumulation and cell death. The protective and potent efficacy of this naturally occurring vitamin, with no established clinical side effects, suggests a potential therapeutic application in preventing oxidative damage to undifferentiated oligodendrocytes in perinatal hypoxic/ischemic brain injury.},

QUIN is an agonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and it has a high in vivo potency as an excitotoxin. In fact, although QUIN has an uptake system, its neuronal degradation enzyme is rapidly saturated, and the rest of extracellular QUIN can continue stimulating the NMDA receptor. However, its toxicity cannot be fully explained by its activation of NMDA receptors it is likely that additional mechanisms may also be involved. In this review we describe some of the most relevant targets of QUIN neurotoxicity which involves presynaptic receptors, energetic dysfunction, oxidative stress, transcription factors, cytoskeletal disruption, behavior alterations, and cell death.},

  abstract = {Canavan's disease (CD) is a fatal, hereditary disorder of CNS development that has been linked to mutations in the gene for the enzyme aspartoacylase (ASPA) (EC 3.5.1.15). ASPA acts to hydrolyze N-acetylaspartate (NAA) into l-aspartate and acetate, but the connection between ASPA deficiency and the failure of proper CNS development is unclear. We hypothesize that one function of ASPA is to provide acetate for the increased lipid synthesis that occurs during postnatal CNS myelination. The gene encoding ASPA has been inactivated in the mouse model of CD, and here we show significant decreases in the synthesis of six classes of myelinassociated lipids, as well as reduced acetate levels, in the brains of these mice at the time of peak postnatal CNS myelination. Analysis of the lipid content of white matter from a human CD patient showed decreased cerebroside and sulfatide relative to normal white matter. These results demonstrate that myelin lipid synthesis is significantly compromised in CD and provide direct evidence that defective myelin synthesis, resulting from a deficiency of NAA-derived acetate, is involved in the pathogenesis of CD.},

Prior studies using dichotomous categorization of alcohol use and comorbid substance exposures provide limited knowledge of how prenatal alcohol specifically impacts early human neurodevelopment. In this longitudinal cohort study from Cape Town, South Africa, PAE is measured continuously—characterizing timing, dose, and drinking patterns (i.e., binge drinking). High-density electroencephalography (EEG) during a visual-evoked potential (VEP) task was collected from infants aged 8 to 52 weeks with prenatal exposure exclusively to alcohol and matched on sociodemographic factors to infants with no substance exposure in utero. First trimester alcohol exposure related to altered timing of the P1 VEP component over the first 6 months postnatally, and first trimester binge drinking exposure altered timing of the P1 VEP components such that increased exposure was associated with longer VEP latencies while increasing age was related to shorter VEP latencies (n = 108). These results suggest alcohol exposure in the first trimester may alter visual neurodevelopmental timing in early infancy. Exploratory individual-difference analysis across infants with and without PAE tested the relation between VEP latencies and myelination for a subsample of infants with usable magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) T1w and T2w scans collected at the same time point as EEG (n = 47). Decreased MRI T1w/T2w ratios (an indicator of myelin) in the primary visual cortex (n = 47) were linked to longer P1 VEP latencies. Results from these two sets of analyses suggest that prenatal alcohol and postnatal myelination may both separately impact VEP latency over infancy.

  abstract = {Early environments can have significant and lasting effects on brain, body, and behavior across the lifecourse. Here, we address current research efforts to understand how experiences impact neurodevelopment with a new perspective integrating two well-known conceptual frameworks – the Developmental Origins of Health and Disease (DOHaD) and sensitive/critical period frameworks. Specifically, we consider how prenatal experiences characterized in the DOHaD model impact two key neurobiological mechanisms of sensitive/critical periods for adapting to and learning from the postnatal environment. We draw from both animal and human research to summarize the current state of knowledge on how particular prenatal substance exposures (psychoactive substances and heavy metals) and nutritional profiles (protein-energy malnutrition and iron deficiency) each differentially impact brain circuits' excitation/GABAergic inhibition balance and myelination. Finally, we highlight new research directions that emerge from this integrated framework, including testing how prenatal environments alter sensitive/critical period timing and learning and identifying potential promotional/buffering prenatal exposures to impact postnatal sensitive/critical periods. We hope this integrative framework considering prenatal influences on postnatal neuroplasticity will stimulate new research to understand how early environments have lasting consequences on our brains, behavior, and health.},

We analyzed the cerebral metabolome of germ-free (GF) mice and Ex-GF mice, which were inoculated with suspension of feces obtained from specific pathogen-free mice, using capillary electrophoresis with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (CE-TOFMS). CE-TOFMS identified 196 metabolites from the cerebral metabolome in both GF and Ex-GF mice. The concentrations of 38 metabolites differed significantly (p\,{$<$}\,0.05) between GF and Ex-GF mice. Approximately 10 of these metabolites are known to be involved in brain function, whilst the functions of the remainder are unclear. Furthermore, we observed a novel association between cerebral glycolytic metabolism and intestinal microbiota. Our work shows that cerebral metabolites are influenced by normal intestinal microbiota through the microbiota-gut-brain axis, and indicates that normal intestinal microbiota closely connected with brain health and disease, development, attenuation, learning, memory, and behavior.},

  abstract = {Animal experiments and small clinical studies support a role for the gut microbiota in cognitive functioning. Few studies have investigated gut microbiota and cognition in large community samples.To examine associations of gut microbial composition with measures of cognition in an established population-based study of middle-aged adults.This cross-sectional study analyzed data from the prospective Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort in 4 US metropolitan centers between 2015 and 2016. Data were analyzed in 2019 and 2020.Stool DNA were sequenced, and the following gut microbial measures were gathered: (1) β-diversity (between-person) derived with multivariate principal coordinates analysis; (2) α-diversity (within-person), defined as richness (genera count) and the Shannon index (integrative measure of genera richness and evenness); and (3) taxonomy (107 genera, after filtering).Cognitive status was assessed using 6 clinic-administered cognitive tests: Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST), Rey-Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT), Stroop, category fluency, and letter fluency. A global score measure derived using principal components analysis was also assessed; the first principal component explained 56\% of variability.Microbiome data were available on 597 CARDIA participants; mean (SD) age was 55.2 (3.5) years, 268 participants (44.7\%) were men, and 270 (45.2\%) were Black. In multivariable-adjusted principal coordinates analysis, permutational multivariate analysis of variance tests for β-diversity were statistically significant for all cognition measures (principal component analysis, P\,=\,.001; MoCA, P\,=\,.001; DSST, P\,=\,.001; RAVLT, P\,=\,.001; Stroop, P\,=\,.007; category fluency, P\,=\,.001) with the exception of letter fluency (P\,=\,.07). After adjusting for sociodemographic variables (age, race, sex, education), health behaviors (physical activity, diet, smoking, medication use), and clinical covariates (body mass index, diabetes, hypertension), Barnesiella was positively associated with the first principal component (β, 0.16; 95\% CI, 0.08-0.24), DSST (β, 1.18; 95\% CI, 0.35-2.00), and category fluency (β, 0.59; 95\% CI, 0.31-0.87); Lachnospiraceae FCS020 group was positively associated with DSST (β, 2.67; 95\% CI, 1.10-4.23), and Sutterella was negatively associated with MoCA (β, −0.27; 95\% CI, −0.44 to −0.11).In this cross-sectional study, microbial community composition, based on β-diversity, was associated with all cognitive measures in multivariable-adjusted analysis. These data contribute to a growing body of literature suggesting that the gut microbiota may be associated with cognitive aging, but must be replicated in larger samples and further researched to identify relevant pathways.},

  abstract = {Electroencephalography (EEG) is an important tool in the field of developmental cognitive neuroscience for indexing neural activity. However, racial biases persist in EEG research that limit the utility of this tool. One bias comes from the structure of EEG nets/caps that do not facilitate equitable data collection across hair textures and types. Recent efforts have improved EEG net/cap design, but these solutions can be time-intensive, reduce sensor density, and are more difficult to implement in younger populations. The present study focused on testing EEG sensor net designs over infancy. Specifically, we compared EEG data quality and retention between two high-density saline-based EEG sensor net designs from the same company (Magstim EGI, Whitland, UK) within the same infants during a baseline EEG paradigm. We found that within infants, the tall sensor nets resulted in lower impedances during collection, including lower impedances in the key online reference electrode for those with greater hair heights and resulted in a greater number of usable EEG channels and data segments retained during pre-processing. These results suggest that along with other best practices, the modified tall sensor net design is useful for improving data quality and retention in infant participants with curly or tightly-coiled hair.},

When intestinal homeostasis is perturbed, the function of the gastrointestinal tract and other organ systems, including the brain, can be compromised. The gut microbiota is proposed to contribute to blood-brain barrier disruption and the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases. While progress is being made, a better understanding of interactions between gut microbes and host cells, and the impact these have on signaling from gut to brain is now required. In this review, we summarise current evidence of the impact gut microbes and their metabolites have on blood-brain barrier integrity and brain function, and the communication networks between the gastrointestinal tract and brain, which they may modulate. We also discuss the potential of microbiota modulation strategies as therapeutic tools for promoting and restoring brain health.},

  abstract = {Gut microbiota alterations have been described in several diseases with altered gastrointestinal (GI) motility, and awareness is increasing regarding the role of the gut microbiome in modulating GI function. Serotonin [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)] is a key regulator of GI motility and secretion. To determine the relationship among gut microbes, colonic contractility, and host serotonergic gene expression, we evaluated mice that were germ-free (GF) or humanized (HM; ex-GF colonized with human gut microbiota). 5-HT reduced contractile duration in both GF and HM colons. Microbiota from HM and conventionally raised (CR) mice significantly increased colonic mRNAs Tph1 [(tryptophan hydroxylase) 1, rate limiting for mucosal 5-HT synthesis; P {$<$} 0.01] and chromogranin A (neuroendocrine secretion; P {$<$} 0.01), with no effect on monoamine oxidase A (serotonin catabolism), serotonin receptor 5-HT4, or mouse serotonin transporter. HM and CR mice also had increased colonic Tph1 protein (P {$<$} 0.05) and 5-HT concentrations (GF, 17 ± 3 ng/mg; HM, 25 ± 2 ng/mg; and CR, 35 ± 3 ng/mg; P {$<$} 0.05). Enterochromaffin (EC) cell numbers (cells producing 5-HT) were unchanged. Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) promoted TPH1 transcription in BON cells (human EC cell model). Thus, gut microbiota acting through SCFAs are important determinants of enteric 5-HT production and homeostasis.—Reigstad, C. S., Salmonson, C. E., Rainey, III, J. F., Szurszewski, J. H., Linden, D.

  abstract = {While bidirectional brain-gut interactions are well known mechanisms for the regulation of gut function in both healthy and diseased states, a role of the enteric flora--including both commensal and pathogenic organisms--in these interactions has only been recognized in the past few years. The brain can influence commensal organisms (enteric microbiota) indirectly, via changes in gastrointestinal motility and secretion, and intestinal permeability, or directly, via signaling molecules released into the gut lumen from cells in the lamina propria (enterochromaffin cells, neurons, immune cells). Communication from enteric microbiota to the host can occur via multiple mechanisms, including epithelial-cell, receptor-mediated signaling and, when intestinal permeability is increased, through direct stimulation of host cells in the lamina propria. Enterochromaffin cells are important bidirectional transducers that regulate communication between the gut lumen and the nervous system. Vagal, afferent innervation of enterochromaffin cells provides a direct pathway for enterochromaffin-cell signaling to neuronal circuits, which may have an important role in pain and immune-response modulation, control of background emotions and other homeostatic functions. Disruption of the bidirectional interactions between the enteric microbiota and the nervous system may be involved in the pathophysiology of acute and chronic gastrointestinal disease states, including functional and inflammatory bowel disorders.},

Administration of GABA (600 mg/kg body weight [b. wt.]) alone increased brain GABA concentration (33\%, p {$<$} 0.01), when compared to untreated rats and administration of L-Arg (2000 mg/kg b. wt.) alone also increased GABA concentration (65\%, p {$<$} 0.01) in the brain. Moreover, GABA + L-Arg treated brains showed a fourfold increase in GABA level (383.3\%, p {$<$} 0.01) when compared to controls. Dose-dependent increase in nitric oxide production was observed 10 min after i.p injections of L-Arg (400, 800, 1000, and 2000 mg/kg b. wt.) and a peak nitric oxide (NO) production was observed at the dose level of 2000 mg/kg b. wt. On the other hand, administration of GABA failed to increase NO production in the brain. Rats pretreated (10 min) with a nonspecific nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor Nω-nitro-L-Arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 50 mg/kg b. wt.) completely blocked the production of NO induced by L-Arg. In addition, L-NAME attenuated GABA entry into the brain after the administration of GABA alone or in combination with L-Arg. We conclude that high NO concentrations in the brain following L-Arg administration may increase the permeability of BBB to peripheral GABA.},

Corresponding data in human populations are lacking.To study associations between the gut microbiome in infants and development at preschool age measured by the Ages and Stages Questionnaire, third edition (ASQ-3).This ancillary cohort study of the Vitamin D Antenatal Asthma Reduction Trial (VDAART) used data from 715 participants who had development assessed at 3 years of age by the ASQ-3, which included scores in 5 domains (gross motor skills, fine motor skills, problem solving, communication, and personal and social skills). A total of 309 stool samples were collected from infants aged 3 to 6 months for microbiome analysis using 16S rRNA gene sequencing.Infant gut microbiome.Continuous ASQ-3 scores and typical vs potential delay in the 5 developmental domains. Factor scores for bacterial coabundance groups were used as predictors in regression models of continuous ASQ-3 scores. Logistic regression was used to examine bacterial coabundance scores and odds of scoring below the threshold for typical development. Multivariate analysis examined the abundance of individual taxa and ASQ-3 scores.The 309 participants (170 [55.0\%] male) with ASQ-3 scores and stool samples  were ethnically diverse (136 [44.0\%] black, 41 [13.3\%] Hispanic, 86 [27.8\%] white, and 46 [14.9\%] other race/ethnicity); the mean (SD) age at ASQ-3 assessment was 3.0 (0.07) years. Coabundance scores dominated by Clostridiales (Lachnospiraceae genera and other, unclassified Clostridiales taxa) were associated with poorer ASQ-3 communication (β, –1.12; 95\% CI, −2.23 to −0.01; P\,=\,.05) and personal and social (β, –1.44; 95\% CI, −2.47 to −0.40; P\,=\,.01) scores and with increased odds of potential delay for communication (odds ratio [OR], 1.69; 95\% CI, 1.06 to 2.68) and personal and social skills (OR, 1.96; 95\% CI, 1.22 to 3.15) per unit increase in coabundance score. The Bacteroides-dominated coabundance grouping was associated with poorer fine motor scores (β, –2.42; 95\% CI, −4.29 to −0.55; P\,=\,.01) and with increased odds of potential delay for fine motor skills (OR, 1.52; 95\% CI, 1.07 to 2.16) per unit increase in coabundance score. Multivariate analysis detected similar family-level and order-level associations.These findings suggest an association between infant gut microbiome composition and communication, personal and social, and fine motor skills at age 3 years. The majority of associations were driven by taxa within the order Clostridiales.},

Here, we describe a powerful analytical method called Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for interpreting gene expression data. The method derives its power by focusing on gene sets, that is, groups of genes that share common biological function, chromosomal location, or regulation. We demonstrate how GSEA yields insights into several cancer-related data sets, including leukemia and lung cancer. Notably, where single-gene analysis finds little similarity between two independent studies of patient survival in lung cancer, GSEA reveals many biological pathways in common. The GSEA method is embodied in a freely available software package, together with an initial database of 1,325 biologically defined gene sets.},

  abstract = {Motivation: Redundant protein sequences in biological databases hinder sequence similarity searches and make interpretation of search results difficult. Clustering of protein sequence space based on sequence similarity helps organize all sequences into manageable datasets and reduces sampling bias and overrepresentation of sequences.Results: The UniRef (UniProt Reference Clusters) provide clustered sets of sequences from the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB) and selected UniProt Archive records to obtain complete coverage of sequence space at several resolutions while hiding redundant sequences. Currently covering \&gt;4 million source sequences, the UniRef100 database combines identical sequences and subfragments from any source organism into a single UniRef entry. UniRef90 and UniRef50 are built by clustering UniRef100 sequences at the 90 or 50\% sequence identity levels. UniRef100, UniRef90 and UniRef50 yield a database size reduction of ∼10, 40 and 70\%, respectively, from the source sequence set. The reduced redundancy increases the speed of similarity searches and improves detection of distant relationships. UniRef entries contain summary cluster and membership information, including the sequence of a representative protein, member count and common taxonomy of the cluster, the accession numbers of all the merged entries and links to rich functional annotation in UniProtKB to facilitate biological discovery. UniRef has already been applied to broad research areas ranging from genome annotation to proteomics data analysis.Availability: UniRef is updated biweekly and is available for online search and retrieval at http://www.uniprot.org, as well as for download at ftp://ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/unirefContact:bes23@georgetown.eduSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

  abstract = {In this study, the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) transporter at the blood-brain barrier (BBB) was identified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot, and immunostaining analysis, and the transport mechanism was characterized using a conditionally immortalized mouse brain capillary endothelial cell line (TM-BBB) as an in vitro model of the BBB. gamma-Aminobutyric acid transport was studied by the cellular uptake of [ 3 H]GABA. [3H]GABA uptake by TM-BBB cells was Na (+)-, Cl(-)-, and concentration-dependent. The corresponding Michaelis-Menten constant was 679 +/- 80 micromol/L and the maximal uptake rate was 4,790 +/- 494 pmol/(mg protein x 5 minutes). [3H]GABA uptake by TM-BBB cells was significantly inhibited by betaine, beta-alanine, nipecotic acid, taurine, and quinidine, whereas probenecid, L-proline, creatine, and glycine had no effect. This type of inhibition is consistent with the predominant involvement of the GAT2/BGT-1 transporter in TM-BBB cells. RT-PCR analysis showed that GAT2/BGT-1 mRNA was expressed in TM-BBB cells, whereas Western blot analysis showed that TM-BBB cells and mouse brain capillaries express GAT2/BGT-1 protein. Moreover, confocal immunofluorescent microscopy of dual-labeled mouse brain sections demonstrated the colocalization of GAT2/BGT-1 and P-glycoprotein, a BBB-specific marker, on brain capillaries labeled with anti-GAT2/BGT-1 antibody and anti-P-glycoprotein antibody, respectively. These results are evidence that GAT2/BGT-1 is expressed at the BBB and is involved in GABA transport across the BBB.},

  abstract = {The potency of the environment to shape brain function changes dramatically across the lifespan. Neural circuits exhibit profound plasticity during early life and are later stabilized. A focus on the cellular and molecular bases of these developmental trajectories has begun to unravel mechanisms, which control the onset and closure of such critical periods. Two important concepts have emerged from the study of critical periods in the visual cortex: (1) excitatory-inhibitory circuit balance is a trigger; and (2) molecular "brakes" limit adult plasticity. The onset of the critical period is determined by the maturation of specific GABA circuits. Targeting these circuits using pharmacological or genetic approaches can trigger premature onset or induce a delay. These manipulations are so powerful that animals of identical chronological age may be at the peak, before, or past their plastic window. Thus, critical period timing per se is plastic. Conversely, one of the outcomes of normal development is to stabilize the neural networks initially sculpted by experience. Rather than being passively lost, the brain's intrinsic potential for plasticity is actively dampened. This is demonstrated by the late expression of brake-like factors, which reversibly limit excessive circuit rewiring beyond a critical period. Interestingly, many of these plasticity regulators are found in the extracellular milieu. Understanding why so many regulators exist, how they interact and, ultimately, how to lift them in noninvasive ways may hold the key to novel therapies and lifelong learning.},

Both sensory and contextual signals are important for induction of this plasticity, but how these signals converge to sculpt developing thalamocortical circuits remains largely unknown. Here we show that layer 1 (L1) of primary auditory cortex (A1) is a key hub where neuromodulatory and topographically organized thalamic inputs meet to tune the cortical layers below. Inhibitory interneurons in L1 send narrowly descending projections to differentially modulate thalamic drive to pyramidal and parvalbumin-expressing (PV) cells in L4, creating brief windows of intracolumnar activation. Silencing of L1 (but not VIP-expressing) cells abolishes map plasticity during the tonotopic critical period. Developmental transitions in nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) sensitivity in these cells caused by Lynx1 protein can be overridden to extend critical-period closure. Notably, thalamocortical maps in L1 are themselves stable, and serve as a scaffold for cortical plasticity throughout life.},

  abstract = {Dysbiosis of gut microbiota has been retrospectively linked to autism spectrum disorders but the temporal association between gut microbiota and early neurodevelopment in healthy infants is largely unknown. We undertook this study to determine associations between gut microbiota at two critical periods during infancy and neurodevelopment in a general population birth cohort. Here, we analyzed data from 405 infants (199 females) from the CHILD (Canadian Healthy Infant Longitudinal Development) Cohort Study. Neurodevelopmental outcomes were objectively assessed using the Bayley Scale of Infant Development (BSID-III) at 1 and 2~years of age. Microbiota profiling with 16S rRNA gene sequencing was conducted on fecal samples obtained at a mean age of 4 and 12~months. Using clustering methods, we identified three groups of infants based on relative abundance of gut microbiota at 12~months: Proteobacteria-dominant cluster (22.4\% higher abundance at 12~months), Firmicutes-dominant cluster (46.0\% higher abundance at 12~months) and Bacteroidetes-dominant cluster (31.6\% higher abundance at 12~months). Relative to the Proteobacteria-dominant cluster, the Bacteroidetes-dominant cluster was associated with higher scores for cognitive (4.8 points; FDRp~=~.02), language (4.2 points; FDRp≤0.001), and motor (3.1 points; FDRp~=~.03) development at age 2 in models adjusted for covariates. When stratified by sex, only male infants with a Bacteroidetes-dominant microbiota had more favorable cognitive (5.9 points, FDRp~=~.06) and language (7.9 points; FDRp≤0.001) development. Genus Bacteroides abundance in gut microbiota was positively correlated with cognitive and language scores at age 2. Fully adjusted linear mixed model analysis revealed a positive association between Bacteroidetes-dominant cluster and change in cognitive and language performance from 1 to 2~years, predominantly among males. No associations were evident between 4-month microbiota clusters and BSID-II scores. Noteworthy is that enhanced sphingolipid synthesis and metabolism, and antagonism or competition between Bacteroides and Streptococcus were characteristic of a Bacteroidetes-dominant gut microbiota. This study found strong evidence of positive associations between Bacteroidetes gut microbiota in late infancy and subsequent neurodevelopment, most prominently among males but not females.},

Such results indicate that QA is able to selectively inhibit the vesicular uptake of glutamate, without interfering with the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitters GABA and glycine. These findings might be related to the neurotoxic effects of QA in the brain.},

  abstract = {Cortical circuitries are highly sensitive to experience during early life but this phase of heightened plasticity decreases with development. We recently demonstrated that fluoxetine reinstates a juvenile-like form of plasticity in the adult visual system. Here we explored cellular and molecular mechanisms that underlie the occurrence of these plastic phenomena. Adult rats were intracortically treated with serotonin (5-HT) whereas long-term fluoxetine-treated rats were infused with the 5-HT1A-receptor antagonist WAY-100635, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) scavenger trkB-IgG or the mitogen-activated protein kinase inhibitor U0126. Plasticity was assessed as variations of visual cortex responsiveness after unilateral eyelid suture and reverse occlusion by using an electrophysiological approach. Real-time PCR and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis were then used to explore alterations in gene expression and modifications of chromatin structure associated with the plastic outcome caused by fluoxetine in the visual system. Local infusion of 5-HT into visual cortex restored susceptibility to monocular deprivation in adulthood whereas infusion of WAY-100635, trkB-IgG or U0126 prevented the process of plasticity reactivation in fluoxetine-treated animals. Long-term fluoxetine treatment promoted a transient increase of Bdnf expression in the visual cortex, which was paralleled by an increased histone acetylation status at Bdnf promoter regions and by decreased expression of Hdac5. Accordingly, enhancing histone acetylation levels by systemic treatment with Trichostatin-A reactivated plasticity in the adult while WAY-100635-infusion prevented epigenetic modifications in Bdnf promoter areas. The data suggest a key role for 5-HT1A receptor and BDNF-trkB signalling in driving a transitory epigenetic remodelling of chromatin structure that underlies the reactivation of plasticity in the visual system.},

  abstract = {The gut microbial community is dynamic during the first 3 years of life, before stabilizing to an adult-like state. However, little is known about the impact of environmental factors on the developing human gut microbiome. We report a longitudinal study of the gut microbiome based on DNA sequence analysis of monthly stool samples and clinical information from 39 children, about half of whom received multiple courses of antibiotics during the first 3 years of life. Whereas the gut microbiome of most children born by vaginal delivery was dominated by Bacteroides species, the four children born by cesarean section and about 20\% of vaginally born children lacked Bacteroides in the first 6 to 18 months of life. Longitudinal sampling, coupled with whole-genome shotgun sequencing, allowed detection of strain-level variation as well as the abundance of antibiotic resistance genes. The microbiota of antibiotic-treated children was less diverse in terms of both bacterial species and strains, with some species often dominated by single strains. In addition, we observed short-term composition changes between consecutive samples from children treated with antibiotics. Antibiotic resistance genes carried on microbial chromosomes showed a peak in abundance after antibiotic treatment followed by a sharp decline, whereas some genes carried on mobile elements persisted longer after antibiotic therapy ended. Our results highlight the value of high-density longitudinal sampling studies with high-resolution strain profiling for studying the establishment and response to perturbation of the infant gut microbiome.},

  abstract = {To investigate the relationship between size of demyelinated lesion, extent of axonal loss, and degree of latency delay of visual evoked potentials (VEPs) in a rat model of experimental demyelination.    Lysolecithin 1\% (0.4 or 0.8 μL) was microinjected into an optic nerve of each of 14 rats 2 mm posterior to the globe. Standard flash VEPs were recorded with skull-implanted electrodes before and 2, 4, and 6 days after the microinjection. The optic nerves were stained with Luxol-fast blue and Bielschowsky's silver to assess demyelination and axonal pathology, respectively. Demyelinated areas were measured on serial sections, and lesion volumes were deduced by three-dimensional reconstruction.    Focal lesions of demyelination and variable axonal loss were observed. The mean volume of the lesion was 3.2 ± 1.1 × 10−2 mm3. The injected eye showed a significant latency delay and amplitude decrease. Regression analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between N1 latency delay and lesion volume (r = 0.863, P \&lt; 0.0001), which remained significant after adjustment for axonal loss (r = 0.829, P \&lt; 0.001). N1 latency delay also showed a correlation with axonal loss (r = 0.552, P = 0.041), but the correlation became nonsignificant when controlling for demyelination (r = 0.387, P = 0.191). A linear association between N1-P2 amplitude decrease and axonal loss (r = 0.681, P = 0.007) was also observed.    The latency of the VEP accurately reflected the amount of demyelination in the visual pathway, whereas the amplitude correlated with axonal damage. This study supports the concept that the VEP provides a highly sensitive tool with which to measure demyelination in optic neuritis.},
